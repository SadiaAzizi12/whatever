First User Prompt: The program starts at input("Enter a num please"). It pauses execution, displays that message to the user, and waits for them to type a value and hit Enter.

First String Storage: Whatever the user types is stored in the variable firstNum as a String (text). Even if they type 10, Python sees it as the character "1" and the character "0".

Second User Prompt: The program moves to input("Enter a second num please"). It pauses again, displays the second message, and waits for a second value.

Second String Storage: This value is stored in secondNum, also as a String.

Type Conversion (Casting): The lines int(firstNum) and int(secondNum) take those text strings and convert them into Integers (whole numbers). This tells Python, "Stop treating these as text and start treating them as values."

Addition Calculation: In the first print statement, Python calculates the sum of the two integers using the + operator.

Subtraction Calculation: In the second print statement, Python calculates the difference using the - operator.

Final Output: The results are displayed on the screen along with labels.
